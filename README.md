# Storefront Project

## Description

This project is a storefront built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, focusing on modular component-based architecture and TypeScript for type safety. The storefront allows customers to view a list of products, filter products by collection, visit product details pages, and choose among product variants.

## Time Spent

Approximately 6 days were spent on this project.

## Challenging Implementation

The most challenging aspect of this project was navigating the routing options available in Next.js, deciding which approach to use based on the project requirements and balancing between server-side rendering and client-side navigation was a significant decision point.

Ensuring smooth navigation between the product list, product details pages, and handling dynamic filters posed initial complexities that required careful consideration and planning.

## Most Proud Implementation

I'm especially proud of trying Next.js routing for the first time and leveraging Tailwind CSS effectively. Learning Next.js routing facilitated smooth transitions and dynamic content loading, enhancing user navigation across product listings and details pages.

Implementing responsive design with Tailwind CSS for the first time was also a significant achievement. It ensured the storefront's functionality and aesthetics remained top-notch across various devices and screen sizes, delivering a polished user experience.

## Project Structure and Considerations

### Folder Structure

    /components: Contains reusable React components used across the application.
    /pages: Contains Next.js pages used to route to different parts of the application.
    /public: Contains static assets like images.

### Technical Choices

    Next.js: Chosen for its SSR capabilities, efficient routing, and built-in TypeScript support.
    Tailwind CSS: Used for styling to maintain a modular and responsive design system.
    TypeScript: Utilized for static typing to catch errors early and improve code maintainability.
    Modular Component Approach: Components are designed to be modular and reusable, enhancing code readability and scalability.
    Responsive Design: Ensured the storefront is responsive using Tailwind CSS utility classes and media queries.
